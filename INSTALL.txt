JavaScript Static Analysis Tool
Installation Guide

Last Updated: May 18, 2012

1.  After downloading the gzipped tarball into a directory, unzip it to a
    directory of choice. A directory called jsAnalysis should appear. 

2.  All the source files should be located in the directory jsAnalysis/src. 

3.  If the operating system is UNIX, there is a script that can be run for a
    demonstration, called runanalyzer.sh, which is located in jsAnalysis/src.

    This script will create the Datalog facts for the extensions located in
    jsAnalysis/tests/extensions, then create a log file describing the results
    of running the script in jsAnalysis/tests_out/results.txt.

    To check if jsAnalysis has been installed correctly, the output results.txt
    can be compared with the provided output results_sample.txt. Running a
    simple diff command on the generated results.txt against the provided sample
    results_sample.txt should verify if the installation has been done
    correctly. In addition, there should be a number of Datalog files generated
    for the extensions that are successful.
