Instructions for Sample Queries for the Datalog Facts

1.  First, open the DES program, which is located in jsAnalysis/src/des. The
    binary executable file is called "des" as well. 
    
    For convenience, we can navigate to the jsAnalysis/datalog_facts directory,
    then type:

    ../src/des/des

    to launch the DES program.

2.  Once in the program, we can process the datalog facts using the consult
    directive. Type this on the DES interactive prompt:
    
    DES> /consult <filename>

    and replace <filename> with the file containing the Datalog facts. 

3.  The following basic example queries are useful to find out chrome
    occurrences in the JavaScript program we're trying to analyze. 

    -   ptsTo(X, d_chrome). 
        Finds out all variables that are pointing to the real chrome object.
        Usually computationally intensive. Can replace d_chrome with other
        chrome APIs such as d_chrome_tabs, or d_chrome_tabs_detectLanguage.

    -   assign(X, chrome).
    -   load(X, chrome, Y).
        Finds all the variables that are being assigned the value of chrome, or
        in the second query, chrome.*.

    -   loadExtendedTwo(chrome, X, Y).
        Finds all the occurrences of chrome.*.* in the program. For example,
        chrome.tabs.detectLanguage

    -   loadExtendedThree(chrome, X, Y, Z).
        Finds all the occurrences of chrome.*.*.* in the program. For example,
        chrome.extension.onRequest.addListener
