2 Replace call, other references

For each extension:
    1. # of functions, including nested ones
    2. Call graph (in DOT format)

1.  Check all assignments on the AST that contain the chrome keyword on the right hand side, 
    and print it out

2.  Alpha-renamed AST -> 3A Analysis -> List of statements.

	Three-address code. Take a pyNarcissus, and generate a list of statements in three-address form.
	At most three operands, the first operand is an =. 
	Take all the integer operations, 
	+, -, *, / -> intOp
	>, <, >=, -> relOp
	&, |,     -> bitwiseOp
	.         -> dotOp
	call      -> callOp
	Throw away:
		- Control structures.
	
	<empty> = <empty> return <val>
	t       = <empty> new <val>
	foo     = <empty> function
